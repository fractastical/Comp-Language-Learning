Basically a port of my "human language learning repo":https://github.com/fractastical/Language-Learning to deal with the various computer languages which I know and am working on at any given time.

At the moment (written '12) meat and potatoes is in the enterprise, while interests generally lie elsewhere. Attempting to weave together making money, doing things that I love, and doing things that are educational (e.g. outside my current strengths).

At the verge of '17 I'm attempting to double down on new talent sets, namely sales, marketing, biz dev, top level coordination, while keeping a good bit of activity in at least staying aware of top level trends in associated technologies. Of special interest is smart contract languages and secure compute at the lowest hardware level.
